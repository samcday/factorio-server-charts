## Number of replicas to create (only 1 is supported)
replicaCount: 1

image:
  repository: "factoriotools/factorio"
  ## Container image pull policy
  pullPolicy: Always
  ## Overrides the image tag whose default is the chart appVersion.
  tag: "latest"
  ## You should set an fix version, i.e.:
  # tag: "1.1.37"

nodeSelector: {}

#  beta.kubernetes.io/arch: amd64
#  kubernetes.io/hostname: your-cool-hostname


## The service is a kind tricky, so factorio uses UDP, but not every cloud provider is able to route UDP traffic.
## I.e. your cloud provider has LoadBalancers without the ability for UDP protocol. Furthermore kubectl ist not able to route UDP Traffic
## ref: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/47862
## You have to expose factorio on a NodePort and map a port between 30000 and 32767, but the native port is 34197. So you have always to specify the port in factorio.
## The best way ist to define a ClusterIP service and define one or more externalIPs. Of course this IPs must be avaiable on the node the factorio pod runs on !
service:
  type: NodePort
  port: 31497
  ## If you are able to map an external IP, set it here
  # externalIPs:
  #  - "192.168.0.1"
  #  - "192.168.0.2"
  # 
  # 
  ## If you use "type: NodePort" set the port to a value you like in the range of 30000-32767. Leave it blank for a random port
  # nodePort: ""
  ## Examples:
  ## NodePort setup
  
  ## ClusterIp setup
  # ClusterIP:
  #   port: 34197
  ## LoadBalancer setup
  # type: LoadBalancer
  annotations: {}


## Compute Resources required by the operator container
resources:
  ## We have to ensure that factorio have enough computing resources avaiable. We set here an absolute minimum
  ## Keep in mind that big factorio base can consume a lot of memory and cpu
  requests:
    memory: 512Mi
    cpu: 500m
  ## If you like to limit factiorio resources
  # limits:
  #   memory: 1024Mi
  #   cpu: 1000m


## Strategy used to replace old pods
## IMPORTANT: use with care, it is suggested to leave as that for upgrade purposes
## ref: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/#strategy

## Sets the data persistence volume configuration
## IMPORTANT: If you do not setup a PV all your savegames will be lost on pod recreation or helm upgrade
persistence:
  enabled: true
  dataDir:
    Size: "1Gi"
    ## If you have an existing claim, set your name here
    # existingClaim: "existing-claim-name"
  ## If you like to use a specific storageClassName, set the name. Leave it blank for the default class
  storageClassName: ""
  ## If you have annotations to spin up a PV i.e. the location. Remove the curly braces
